1
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,660
南极洲
Antarctica.

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,220
地球上极其寒冷、恶劣和偏远的一片大陆。
The coldest, the harshest and the
most remote continent on Earth.

3
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,300
前人尚未下潜到其周边的深海。
No human being has ever descended
into the depths that surround it...

4
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,940
我们这是首次。
until now.

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,660
探索深海的难度,
堪比探索太空。
The deep ocean is as challenging to
explore as space.

6
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,619
人类对海洋深处的了解
We know more about the surface of
Mars than we do about the

7
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,340
还不如对火星表面的了解多。
deepest parts of our seas.

8
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,219
现在我们终于有能力
深潜到这些无人涉足的地方
Now we can dive these uncharted
depths to discover

9
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,460
去发掘其隐藏的奥妙。
what secrets lie beneath.

10
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,619
沿着水下的冰山峭壁下潜，
Sinking down beside the submerged
wall of an iceberg,

11
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,060
我们进入了一个冷酷无情的世界。
we enter an unforgiving world.

12
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,460
这些水域在地球上最为冰冷。
These waters are
the coldest on Earth.

13
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,900
随着我们下潜，水压持续增强。
As we descend into the deep, the
pressure increases relentlessly.

14
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,420
光线尽无，漆黑一片。
And the light from above
all but disappears.

15
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,700
然而，非常神奇……
Yet, incredibly...

16
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,140
这里有生物。
there is life here.

17
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,339
我们原以为，
极地海洋之深深处，
We might have expected that, deep
beneath the surface of

18
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,780
应是一片不毛之地。
the polar seas, the waters would be
truly barren.

19
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,260
然而，这里的生物
却丰富得无法想像。
But in fact we find life here in
unimaginable abundance.

20
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,660
这种丰富也并非局限于南极水域。
Nor is such great abundance confined
to Antarctic waters.

21
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,259
洋流使地球上
几乎所有海洋的深深处
Currents carry this richness into
the depths of almost every ocean

22
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,300
都这么丰富。
around the world.

23
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,579
很吃惊吧，在深海处，
Astonishingly, in the deep sea,

24
00:04:45.91 --> 00:04:49.59
生命竟比地球其他地方都要丰富
there is more life than anywhere else on Earth.

25
00:04:50,580 --> 00:05:2,260
第二集
洋深深处
倾情翻译：高智衡（Q:11279470)
特别鸣谢：岚岚小朋友。You are the motivation.
仅供学习 20171109

26
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,580
光照衰减，海里越来越黑。
The sunlight fades
and the seas darken.

27
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,299
在太平洋海面200米下，
Here in the Pacific,
200 metres down,

28
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
恍如进入了外星世界。
we enter an alien world.

29
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,219
这里是阴阳魔界——
（注：学名中层区，海面下200--1000米处）
The Twilight Zone -

30
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,980
一个恒久幽暗的海域。
a sea of eternal gloom.

31
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,940
充斥着奇妙的生物。
There are strange creatures here.

32
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,780
火体虫
A pyrosome.

33
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,939
啫哩状的体型长达2米，
A tube of jelly two metres long that
dwarfs a visitor from above --

34
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,980
令海上游下来的这只海洋白鳍鲨
也相形见绌了。
an oceanic whitetip shark.

35
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,500
仅有微弱光线能抵达这里。
Only a tiny amount of light filters
down this far.

36
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,900
所以这里的生物
必须充分利用每一线余辉。
Survival here means making the most
of every last glimmer.

37
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,900
剑鱼（又名箭鱼）
A swordfish.

38
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,179
其眼球大如网球，
Its eyes are as big as tennis balls,

39
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,780
哪怕光线再暗，它也能看得见。
to help it see
in the perpetual dusk.

40
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,739
乌贼，
A squid,

41
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,060
这个品种，仅此独有。
but this is one
that lives only here.

42
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,260
它的右眼总是看着下方。
Its right eye looks
permanently downwards.

43
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,539
而左眼大得多，并且总是盯着上方，
But its left eye is much bigger and
trained upwards to detect the

44
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,820
搜寻着在上面猎物的身影。
silhouettes of prey
swimming nearer the surface.

45
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,500
它的别名叫“斗鸡眼乌贼”，很贴切吧。
No wonder it's nicknamed
"the cockeyed squid".

46
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,500
更为神妙的。
And even stranger.

47
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,980
这叫桶眼鱼……
This is barreleye...

48
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,499
它的头部全透明，
a fish with a transparent head

49
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,220
里面全是胶状物，
所以它可透过脑袋望向头顶。
filled with jelly so that it can
look up through its skull.

50
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,059
目前所知，这个阴阳魔界，
We now know that the Twilight Zone
is a refuge for an incredible

51
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,260
为海洋里多达90%的鱼类提供了庇护所。
90% of all fish in the ocean.

52
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,779
夜晚，大量灯笼鱼群迁徙到海面，
Only at night do vast shoals of
lanternfish migrate to the surface

53
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,700
捕食微细的浮游生物。
to feed on tiny plankton.

54
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,900
白天，它们躲回下面这里。
By day, they retreat back down here.

55
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,420
洪堡鱿鱼
Humboldt squid.

56
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,020
长达2米，重50公斤。
Two metres long
and 50 kilos in weight.

57
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,420
如大多数鱿鱼一样，他们是贪婪猎手。
Like most squid,
they're voracious hunters.

58
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,620
这里有数百只。
There are hundreds of them.

59
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,259
它们发现了灯笼鱼群，
They've found a shoal
of lanternfish,

60
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,620
就躲在这南非海岸外800米的海底处。
hiding 800 metres down,
off the coast of South America.

61
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,339
触须上布满了有力的吸盘，
Their tentacles are armed with
powerful suckers

62
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,260
捕捉猎物简直是手到拿来。
with which they grab their prey.

63
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,260
当没有灯笼鱼后……
And when there are no more
lanternfish to be found...

64
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,980
它们竟自相残杀。
they turn on each other.

65
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,300
这只鱿鱼触须内捉了只小鱿鱼。
This squid has caught a smaller one
in its tentacles.

66
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,419
为了隐藏猎物，
To hide its capture from the rest,

67
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,780
它喷出了墨汁。
it releases a smokescreen
of black ink.

68
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,380
但这时另一只更大的鱿鱼过来抢食……
But then an even bigger one
challenges it...

69
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,140
猎物被抢走了。
and steals its catch.

70
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,660
阴阳魔界是洪堡鱿鱼捕猎的最爱场所。
The Twilight Zone is the Humboldt
squid's favoured hunting ground.

71
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,900
他们不会再下潜了……
They seldom go deeper...

72
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,700
再往下，就是暗无天日的黑暗世界……
into the world of perpetual
blackness below...

73
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,780
这里叫午夜魔界。
（注：学名半深海区，海面下1000-4000米处）
The Midnight Zone.

74
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,140
这里深达一千米，阳光已无力抵达。
Two thirds of a mile from the
surface, beyond the reach the sun.

75
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,219
这是个巨大、黑暗而空旷的场所，
A giant black void,

76
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,220
大到比地球上所有其他栖息地加起来都大。
larger than all the rest of the
world's habitats combined.

77
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,820
这里也有生命……
There's life here...

78
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,300
超越我们所知。
but not as we know it.

79
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,180
形如外星物种的生物
发出眩目的光辉。
Alien-like creatures produce
dazzling displays of light.

80
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,620
几乎所有动物都要吸引异性和警吓敌人。
Nearly all animals need to attract
mates and repel predators.

81
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,819
光线式表达广泛使用，
This language of light is so
widespread here that these signals

82
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,499
所以光信号也许是地球上
are probably the commonest
form of communication

83
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,060
最常见的沟通形式了。
on the entire planet.

84
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,540
然而我们知之甚少。
And yet we still know
little about them.

85
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,779
打猎者为自己打灯，
Hunters illuminate themselves,
and by doing so

86
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,700
同时也吸引那些好奇心重的猎物。
attract inquisitive prey.

87
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,260
尖牙鱼。
This is fangtooth.

88
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,060
类似体型的鱼类中，它的牙齿是最大的。
It has the largest teeth for its
size of any fish.

89
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,939
其头部和身体布满了压力感应器，
There are pressure sensors all over
its head and body which can detect

90
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,340
周边任何东西的移动都能感应到。
anything moving
in the surrounding water.

91
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,500
它是午夜魔界中最贪婪的鱼。
It's the Midnight Zone's
most voracious fish.

92
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,620
但猎物会使用光线来干扰。
But prey use light as a distraction.

93
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,940
喷出些磷光油墨。
A decoy of luminous ink.

94
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,620
在这个漆黑一片的深深处，
Down here, in this blackness...

95
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,020
生物的生存突破了时光限制。
creatures live beyond
the normal rules of time.

96
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,499
管水母简直就是长生不老。
Siphonophores are virtually eternal.

97
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
它们不停地生长……
They repeatedly clone themselves...

98
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,780
有些长到甚至比一头蓝鲸还要长。
some eventually growing longer
than a blue whale.

99
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,580
这下面，竟然会“飘雪”。
Down here it snows.

100
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,179
断断续续的有机体碎片团
Continuous clouds of organic debris

101
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,620
从上方慢慢地飘落。
drift slowly down from above.

102
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,139
这些都是食物，滤食类动物
This is food, and a whole variety

103
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,860
全靠此生存。
of filter feeders depend on it.

104
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,620
包括水母……
Jellyfish...

105
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,460
和翩跹的海参。
and delicate sea cucumbers.

106
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,859
有1%的海中飘雪未被滤食
The 1% of marine snow they miss

107
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,140
最终沉到海底。
eventually settles on the sea floor.

108
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,059
经过数百万年后，形成了淤泥，
Over millions of years
it forms a layer of mud

109
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,100
厚达1英里。
up to a mile thick.

110
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,939
构成了一个空旷的平原，
It's an empty plain that covers

111
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,260
覆盖着地球表面的一半。
half the surface of our planet.

112
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,340
深海海床一开始似乎没有生物……
The deep sea bed
may at first appear lifeless...

113
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,740
但这里造就了一种奇特的淤泥生物。
but it's home to
a unique cast of mud-dwellers.

114
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
单棘躄鱼（海蟾蜍）
The sea toad.

115
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,940
这是伏击型捕猎者，长着大大的口
It is an ambush predator
with an enormous mouth...

116
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,620
有无限的耐性。
and infinite patience.

117
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,379
这种鱼已长期生活于此，
This fish has been living
for so long here

118
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,139
它的鳍已进化成
that its fins have changed

119
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,940
更好用的器官——
into something more useful.

120
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,740
就是脚。
Feet.

121
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,300
让它可以穿行于海床。
They help it shuffle about
on the sea floor.

122
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,500
烙饼章鱼（超萌的样子哦）
The flapjack octopus.

123
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,899
它徘徊于泥浆上面，细心查找，
It hovers just above the surface of
the mud as it delicately sifts

124
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,380
探寻蠕虫。
through it, searching for worms.

125
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,220
有一丁点风吹草动，
它就喷射而离，逃之夭夭。
But it can jet away at
the first sign of danger.

126
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,380
灰六鳃鲨，其体形如大白鲨。
A sixgill shark
as big as a great white.

127
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,100
它可能一整年都未进食了。
It may not have eaten
for an entire year.

128
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,699
它在淤泥平原上巡弋，
It patrols the mud plains

129
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,340
用的是它那最省体能的泳姿。
using a minimum amount of energy.

130
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,939
高高的上方，一只巨型抹香鲸的遗体
High above, the carcass of a huge

131
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,740
正在缓缓地腐化。
sperm whale is slowly decaying.

132
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,460
对于深海生物来说，
这是天上掉下来的大馅饼。
This will be a bonanza for the
creatures of the deep.

133
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,780
这是足足有30吨的食物啊。
Food, 30 tonnes of it.

134
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,540
终于，遗体沉降到海床了……
Finally, it settles
on the ocean floor...

135
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,060
而它的现身被迅速察觉。
and its presence is soon detected.

136
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,700
灰六鳃鲨的嗅觉极为敏锐。
Sixgill sharks have an
exceptionally acute sense of smell.

137
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,140
遗体现身后，只需25分钟……
Just 25 minutes after the whale's
carcass arrives...

138
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,180
灰六鳃鲨就发现了它。
a sixgill finds it.

139
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,660
每咬一口，鲜血横流。
Each bite releases blood
into the current.

140
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,260
有食物的消息迅速传开。
The news that food is here
spreads quickly.

141
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,860
另外两条如饥似渴的灰六鳃鲨赶到。
Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.

142
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,219
12小时内
Within 12 hours,

143
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,139
七条穷凶极恶的大鲨鱼，
there are seven enormous sharks

144
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,020
你争我抢，大快朵颐。
jostling with one another as they
compete to tear off mouthfuls.

145
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,700
每一条都争先恐后，毫不退让。
No-one is prepared to back off.

146
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,220
再过24小时，遗体的三分之一已被吃掉。
24 hours later and a third of the
carcass has gone.

147
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,780
最早来到的，已吃撑了。
The first arrival has gorged until
it's completely full.

148
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,980
下一顿，也许要等来年。
This single meal may be enough to
sustain it for a whole year.

149
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
这时候，收拾残局的部队现身了。
Now the clean-up team arrives.

150
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,379
蜘蛛蟹的后腿带有珊瑚，
Spider crabs carrying coral
in their hind legs,

151
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,300
大概是身体的临时盔甲。
presumably as makeshift body armour.

152
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,260
还有石蟹。
There are rock crabs here, too.

153
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,100
也许它们与鲨鱼同时发现遗体的……
They probably detected the carcass
almost as soon as the sharks...

154
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,660
只是跑得比较慢。
but they can't move as fast.

155
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,619
此后一个月，有30多种
A month on, and over 30 species of

156
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,219
腐食动物去消化掉
scavenger are clearing away the last

157
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,740
残存的遗体碎片。
edible fragments.

158
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,340
而这时候，腐食动物们迎来了它们的捕食者。
But now the scavengers are
attracting their own predators.

159
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,939
叉尾带鱼,这种鱼通常只会纵向游动，
Scabbardfish,
habitually swimming upright,

160
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,700
正在逐一捕食。
are picking them off one by one.

161
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,859
鲸鱼的骷髅开始散架了，
Some of the whale's teeth have been
dislodged as the skeleton starts to

162
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,300
而有的牙齿早已脱落。
fall apart.

163
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,220
四个月后，只剩下骸骨一堆。
Four months later, there is nothing
left but a few bones.

164
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,700
而对于某些生物来说……
But even they are food...

165
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,220
这也是食物。
for something.

166
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,820
僵尸蠕虫
Zombie worms.

167
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,180
它们能分泌酸液，然后钻入尸骨……
They tunnel into the bones by
injecting acid...

168
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,060
从而享用残存的微量骨髓。
and so reach the tiny amounts of
fat that still remain there.

169
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,819
It may take decades, but eventually
最终，大约数十年后，

170
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,979
这堆残留的骸骨也将碎成粉末，
the last of the bones will crumble

171
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,459
而整个30吨的遗体，
and the whole 30-tonne carcass

172
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,500
也终于完成了生态循环。
will have been recycled.

173
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,699
这沉底的鲸鱼遗体，有如海床沙漠里
A whale fall is a temporary oasis

174
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,900
短期呈现的绿洲。
in the desert of the sea floor.

175
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,780
而这里，还有永久的绿洲。
But there are permanent
oases here, too.

176
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,579
泥浆层突出的石块，
Rocks projecting above the mud

177
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,540
为深海珊瑚提供了栖身之地。
provide anchorage
for deep-sea corals.

178
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,499
往下深潜3.5英里（约5600米），
As far down as 3.5 miles,

179
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,699
在此深处，珊瑚品种繁多，
there are more species of coral
in the deep

180
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,220
比浅海处的热带珊瑚礁还多。
than on shallow tropical reefs.

181
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,859
没有阳光，
Without sunlight,

182
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,580
它们仅靠水流中的飘浮物维持生命。
they rely solely
on food drifting in the current.

183
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,060
它们一年只长宽
一条头发丝这么点。
And they grow just
a hair's breadth a year.

184
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,420
而有些珊瑚寿命长达4000年。
But some of them can live
for 4,000 years.

185
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,499
就如浅海珊瑚一样，
They, like their shallow water
relatives,

186
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,420
这里的珊瑚为所有其他生物提供了家园。
provide homes for
all kinds of other creatures.

187
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,540
珊瑚中，生长着一种极为美丽的海绵动物。
Growing among the corals is one of
the most beautiful of sponges.

188
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,580
这叫维纳斯花篮。
This is Venus' flower basket.

189
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,100
海绵动物内有寄居客。
These sponges have lodgers.

190
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,100
磷虾
Shrimps.

191
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,459
珊瑚礁里有大量捕食者，
There are plenty of predators
on the reef,

192
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,300
所以磷虾算得上幸福了。
so the shrimps are fortunate.

193
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,419
这一雌一雄，自幼就钻进海绵内了，
Both this male and female were swept
into this sponge

194
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,259
when they were tiny larvae,

195
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,339
伴同海绵所食用的
along with the minute particles of

196
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,660
微细颗粒一起。
food on which the sponge feeds.

197
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,340
它们青梅竹马，长相厮守。
They found each other and have been
here ever since.

198
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,379
现已发育成熟，
Now they're full-grown

199
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,860
雌虾准备产卵。
and the female is carrying eggs.

200
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,940
幼虾孵化后，将游出海绵。
Once hatched, the larvae will swim
out through the sponge's walls.

201
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,740
而成虾则在此终其一生。
But the shrimps will never leave.

202
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,620
它们出不去啊。
They can't.

203
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,259
小时候进得来，但现在体形太大了，
They are now far too big to go out
the way they came in,

204
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,099
而且毫无疑问
它们肯定更愿意长留于此，
and no doubt they will live longer
here than they would

205
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,980
因为如果在外四处浪荡的话，
一点也不保险。
if they were wandering about on the
reef unprotected.

206
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,259
然而，海绵这种最为低等的动物，
But how one of the simplest of all
animals, a sponge,

207
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,779
是如何构建如此复杂的结构，
is able to build
such a complex structure,

208
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,980
去为磷虾提供庇护呢？
to the great benefit of the
shrimps...

209
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,619
这真是个谜……
is a mystery...

210
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,740
神乎其神。
and surely a marvel.

211
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,220
但是，如今，它们的恒久乐土
却面临着土崩瓦解。
But today their timeless world is
being reduced to rubble.

212
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,859
因为过渡打渔，上层海域生物锐减，
As overfishing empties the
surface waters of the seas,

213
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,500
拖网渔船则对深海赶尽杀绝。
trawlers have started
to ransack the deep.

214
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,659
不计其数的珊瑚礁，
Now countless numbers of the reefs

215
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,059
那些数千年以来一直
欣欣向荣的珊瑚礁
that have flourished here
for millennia

216
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,900
如今，沦为死灰。
lie in ruins.

217
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,220
时光流逝，海床上的有机质缓慢腐化……
Over time, organic matter on the sea
floor slowly decays...

218
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,780
产生出沼气。
producing methane.

219
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,219
在墨西哥湾
In the Gulf of Mexico

220
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,100
火山喷释放出超级咸的液体。
these eruptions also release
a super-salty liquid.

221
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,700
卤水
Brine.

222
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,739
其密度比海水高五倍，
Five times heavier than seawater,

223
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,060
它们在海床上大量积淀。
it accumulates in great pools
on the sea floor.

224
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,340
此情此景，难以明述。
It's difficult to make sense
of the sight.

225
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,659
一个15米深的浓缩盐液湖，
A lake of concentrated saltwater,
15 metres deep

226
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,900
就位于海床上。
at the bottom of the sea.

227
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,499
更为神奇的是，在其周边
Around its margin,
perhaps even more strangely,

228
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,140
竟然物种繁多。
there is a profusion of life.

229
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,059
巨蚌，寿命可长达百岁甚至更多，
Giant mussels, that can live and
grow for a century or more,

230
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,139
紧紧地凑在一起，
pack tightly together,

231
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,860
以蚌为食的虾蟹，则相形见绌。
dwarfing the shrimps and squat
lobsters that feed around them.

232
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,699
连鳃鳗、腐食动物等
Cutthroat eels, scavengers,

233
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,700
来到卤水湖边觅食。
come to the shores of the brine lake
in search of something edible.

234
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,460
有的甚至冒险游进卤水。
Some even venture into the brine.

235
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,779
在里面呆久了，
Spending too long in it

236
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,380
能使连鳃鳗中毒性休克。
can send an eel into toxic shock.

237
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,860
求生的唯一指望，就是游出去。
Its only hope is to rise above it.

238
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,300
它挣扎着，成功逃命了。
It manages to escape.

239
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,140
有些就没这么走运。
Others are not so lucky.

240
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,860
卤水能让尸体防腐……
The brine embalms their bodies...

241
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,259
数十年来，罹难的生物
and the casualties of decades

242
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,660
在周边堆积。
accumulate around the margins.

243
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,100
但在深海，有些地方更为凶险。
But parts of the deep are
even more hostile.

244
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,659
好几处地方，巨大的裂缝蜿蜒数英里，
In places, gigantic cracks stretch
for many miles

245
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,740
贯穿着海床……
across the ocean floor...

246
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,420
形成了直探地核的峡谷。
canyons that plunge towards the
centre of the Earth.

247
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,859
通过探测船的扫描，可以画出
Scans from survey vessels make it
possible to graphically reconstruct

248
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,900
这片浩瀚海洋的地貌图谱。
an image of this
vast submarine landscape.

249
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,899
其最深之处，差不多有七英里
（约11公里）
The deepest of all,
at almost seven miles,

250
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,740
那是太平洋的马里亚纳海沟
is the Mariana Trench
in the Pacific Ocean.

251
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,060
连珠穆朗玛峰也比不过它。
Even Mount Everest
could disappear inside it.

252
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,579
这些深深的沟壑里，
Down here, in these deep ravines,

253
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,580
一度被认为，生命无论如何已不复存在。
it was once thought that nothing
whatever could possibly survive.

254
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,300
而事实上，竟然是有……
But there is life even here...

255
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,700
一种海蜗牛。
a kind of sea slug.

256
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
被称为“海猪”
A so-called "sea pig".

257
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,699
它们，以及另外一些低等生物，在此生存，
They, and other simple creatures,
manage to survive on the

258
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,180
所依靠的，
是极其微量飘落此处的食物。
minuscule amount of food
that drifts down here.

259
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,339
这种海星，
Like this starfish,

260
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,299
能承受50架大型喷气式客机的重压。
they can withstand pressure
equivalent of 50 jumbo jets

261
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,460
stacked on top of one another.

262
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,059
远程摄像机揭示了
A remote camera probe reveals

263
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,740
一个最为惊人的发现。
the most extraordinary
discovery of all...

264
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,260
飘逸的狮子鱼。
the ethereal snailfish.

265
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,299
这里足有五英里深，
At five miles down,

266
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,940
这是目前发现的生长在最深海域的鱼。
this is the deepest living fish
so far discovered.

267
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,019
难以想象，
No-one imagined that an animal as

268
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,699
象鱼这样的高等生物
complex as a fish could exist

269
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
竟能在如此巨大的水压下存活。
in such extreme pressures.

270
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,299
从海底最深处，到阴阳魔界的上限，
From the greatest depths to the
uppermost limit of

271
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,819
似乎没有一处，
the Twilight Zone, it seems that
there is nowhere in the deep sea

272
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,580
是生命无法触及的。
where life of some kind
can't survive.

273
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,299
如今我们认为：深海，也许正是
And we now think that the deep sea
may well be

274
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,100
地球生命的起源之处。
where life on Earth began.

275
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,899
这里，潜藏着
Here, in a world hidden within

276
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,940
地球上最为壮观的地貌……
the greatest geological
feature on Earth...

277
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,419
就在各大洋的中心地带，
running right down the middle of
the world's oceans,

278
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,140
存在着环绕全球的海底山脉。
an underwater mountain range,
spanning the entire globe.

279
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,980
这叫大洋中脊(又称中央海岭）
The Mid-Ocean Ridge.

280
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,939
在南太平洋，
In the South Pacific,

281
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,580
海床被大洋中脊所分裂。
the ocean floor is being torn apart.

282
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,019
超过四分之三的地球火山活动
Over three quarters of the planet's
volcanic activity

283
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,820
发生于深海……
occurs in the deep...

284
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,780
其中绝大部分都沿着大洋中脊分布。
almost all of it along the
Mid-Ocean Ridge.

285
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,220
然而，如此剧烈的火山喷发
却造就了物种的多样性。
But from this titanic violence
come great riches.

286
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,980
天然气和滚烫的水从裂缝喷涌而出。
Gases and scalding water gush up
through the crevices.

287
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,540
喷流中冷凝出来的矿物质形成巨大的烟囱……
Minerals condensing from these jets
build up great chimneys...

288
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,940
也就是火山口。
hydrothermal vents.

289
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,899
这个火山口足有30米高，
This one, 30 metres tall,

290
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,980
取名为“哥斯拉”。
has been named Godzilla.

291
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,699
相当惊人的是，目前我们发现
Astonishingly, we now know

292
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,659
其物种的丰富程度，
that they hold as much life

293
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,660
堪比热带雨林。
as tropical rainforests.

294
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,379
某些地方，五十万只动物
In places, half a million
individual animals

295
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,460
聚居在一平方米的面积内。
are crammed into
a single square metre.

296
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,660
它们全靠细菌维持生命。
They depend entirely for
their food on bacteria.

297
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,660
他们以溶解在灸热流体中的化学物质为食。
And THEY feed on chemicals dissolved
in the searingly hot fluid.

298
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,740
蟹所食用的，是覆盖在蟹壳上的细菌层。
Crabs consume the bacterial mats
that coat their shells.

299
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,419
有的生物则在其体内
Others maintain bacterial cultures

300
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,820
培养细菌。
actually within their bodies.

301
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,300
磷虾就在其口腔培养细菌，
Shrimps carry such cultures
in their mouthparts,

302
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,940
但这种策略满带危险。
but that is a strategy
fraught with danger.

303
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,379
因为，要给那些微生物提供营养，
To provide sustenance
for these microbes

304
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,940
磷虾必须冲入炽热的火山口……
the shrimps must dash
into the hot vents...

305
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,660
一不留神，就变成白灼虾咯。
and that risks being boiled alive.

306
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,379
过去十年，
In the last decade

307
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,940
被发现的火山口数量倍增。
the number of hydrothermal vents
discovered has doubled.

308
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,580
每一个都有其独特的物理性质和生物群落。
Every one has its own unique
character and community.

309
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,500
而其中，也许最为重要的一个，
就位于大西洋。
But perhaps the most important one
of all is in the Atlantic.

310
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,660
它被称为“失落之城”。
It has been named "The Lost City".

311
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,859
火山口高达60米，
Within its 60-metre towers,

312
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,980
这里面，奇幻迷离。
something truly extraordinary
is taking place.

313
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,859
在极高的水压和水温下，烃化物——
Under extremes of pressure and
temperature, hydrocarbons -

314
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,859
这种构成所有生物最基本成分的分子——
the molecules that are the basic
component of all living things -

315
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,940
就这么自然而然地合成了。
are being created spontaneously.

316
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,699
事实上，目前许多科学家认为
Indeed, many scientists now believe

317
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,419
地球上的生命正是这么起源的，
that life on Earth may have begun

318
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,139
就在这么样的火山口上，
around a vent like this,

319
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,900
远在40亿年之前。
four billion years ago.

320
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,859
据我们所知，木星和土星的卫星上
We now know that there are deep seas

321
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,780
就存在着深海。
on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

322
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,779
既然这里的极端环境下
If life can exist under such

323
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,379
可以存在生物，
extreme conditions down here,

324
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,739
那么理所当然地，那里也很可能
then surely it could exist

325
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,740
存有生命。
somewhere out there.

326
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,179
摄制组花了上千小时拍摄深海，
The team spent more than 1,000 hours
filming in the deep ocean,

327
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,979
拍摄工具主要就是“阿露雪”号研究船
mostly from the research vessel
Alucia and her twin submersibles,

328
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,060
以及“深漫”号和“耐抵”号这两部潜水神器。
Deep Rover and Nadir.

329
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,620
它们的最大任务就是去南极洲，
Their most ambitious mission
was to Antarctica,

330
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,779
下沉三分之二英里，去拍摄生命，
hoping to film life
two thirds of a mile down,

331
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,620
这是前所未有的探索。
something never attempted before.

332
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,739
老实说，能否有所收获，我们心里没底。
We honestly do not know what we're
going to find down there.

333
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,099
这是个人类从未探索过的地方。
We're going to a place that has
never been explored.

334
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,779
可能一无所获，可能大获丰收，
There could be nothing,
there could be a carpet of life,

335
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,620
也可能间乎两者之间。无从预知。
there could be anything in between.
Who knows?

336
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,980
技术挑战极大。
It's a huge technical challenge.

337
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,940
水温低至零下1.8摄氏度。
The water temperature here can reach
minus 1.8 Centigrade.

338
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,019
如此极端的环境之下，
No-one knows for sure
how the subs will cope

339
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,860
潜水器能否应付得来？没人敢打包票。
with this extreme environment.

340
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,939
好啦，好啦。我来把它清掉。
OK. Right, I'm going to soak it up.
OK.

341
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,859
首次下潜的半小时后，
Just half an hour into the very
first dive,

342
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,460
潜水器舱底出现了一滩水。
a puddle is forming
on the floor of the sub.

343
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,100
奥娜确认这是海水。
Orla confirms it's seawater.

344
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,699
是的，收到。我来把这滩水清除掉吧，
Yeah, Roger. I'm just try to soak up
this puddle of water,

345
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,860
然后再看看还会不会漏水。
and then see if any more comes.

346
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,619
他们必须找到漏点，并快速堵上。
They must find the leak
and repair it fast.

347
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,139
你想在我这上面敲……
Are you going to knock that over
my...? Yeah.

348
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,499
我们的小艇才下潜了450米，
而水渗进来了。
You're at 450 metres in a small
bubble and water's coming in.

349
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,219
升回水面需半小时。
That's a half an hour straight shot
back up to the surface.

350
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,179
心里想着：
You're kind of thinking about,

351
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,780
“水会全灌进来么？这可咋办啊！”
"Are we going to fill up with water?
And if we are, there's no way out!"

352
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,579
是的
Yeah.

353
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,659
船员们训练有素，早有应急预案。
The sub pilots are well drilled for
emergencies.

354
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,019
——递过来吧。   ——好的
Just pass them over. Yeah.

355
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,980
劳夫迅速找到了漏水点并进行修补。
Ralph quickly finds the flood
and fixes it.

356
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,179
他从容自若，
He made it all seem absolutely
ordinary and normal and,

357
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,579
“我可是训练有素，你别担心，”
"I've got this covered,
don't you worry,"

358
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,340
20分钟后，他搞掂了。
and within 20 minutes, he did.

359
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,379
南极洲南部水域也许很富饶，
The waters of the Antarctic Sound
are potentially rich

360
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,140
但也变幻莫测。
but also treacherous.

361
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,780
海峡内地势险恶，有“冰山胡同”之称。
The Sound is ominously known as
"Iceberg Alley".

362
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,379
我们得找个潜水器能安全升降的地方，
We've got to find a place where we
can get the submarines down and up

363
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,099
避免冰山把它们撞翻。
safely without any icebergs coming
along and bowling them over.

364
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,540
这感觉有点象玩"太空侵略者"游戏。
I've got a feeling it's going to be
a bit like a game of Space Invaders.

365
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,419
一立方米的水就重达一吨。
A metre cube of ice weighs a tonne.

366
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,219
你开始在球形舱体上打磨，它相当精美。
You start sort of grinding that
around the sphere, it's delicate.

367
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,100
就象一个巨大的复活节彩蛋。
It's like a big Faberge egg.

368
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:38,020
有次下潜，他们正好来到了冰山的下面。
One dive brings them right up to the
underside face of an iceberg.

369
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,619
上方都是冰山，有的象小汽车这么大，
There are icebergs up there that are
the size of a small car, and

370
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:48,979
有的则大如伦敦海德公园（足有360多英亩）
then there are icebergs up there
that are the size of Hyde Park.

371
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,380
超级大。
Enormous.

372
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,580
环境瞬息万变。
Conditions here
can change in an instant.

373
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,900
船长呼叫着下方的潜艇。
The captain radios down to the subs.

374
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,900
我担心冰块会砸到你们。我就怕这个。
.
.


375
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,860
好的，收到。
Yeah, Roger that.

376
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,019
这里有好几个冰山正在沿着海峡下沉，
We've currently got a couple of big
icebergs coming down

377
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,100
看样子它们将要相撞。
the channel, and it looks like
they're on a collision course.

378
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,699
上方冰山的碰撞声能听得一清二楚。
The impact of two icebergs colliding
overhead is clearly heard.

379
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,540
那是冰块。
That is ice.

380
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,699
冰山相撞的同时，天气急剧恶化，
With icebergs colliding above and
the weather turning fast,

381
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,300
潜艇被迅速召回。
the subs are quickly recalled.

382
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,100
又一次，徒劳而返。
Once again
their efforts are thwarted.

383
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,940
终于，两周后，环境有所改善。
Finally, after two weeks,
conditions are just right.

384
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,820
又来一次，队员们挑战冰山胡同里
1000米的深潜。
Once again the team attempt their
1,000-metre dive in Iceberg Alley.

385
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,340
下潜了一个小时后，他们接近目标了。
An hour after leaving the surface
they close in on their goal.

386
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,820
999米。
999.

387
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,459
指挥官，指挥官。
Control, control.

388
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,059
我是“耐抵”号
This is Nadir

389
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,059
我们正在深潜，深度—— 1000米。
on bottom, depth -
one-zero-zero-zero metres.

390
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,179
收到。 深度 —— 1000米。
Roger. Depth - 1,000 metres.

391
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,380
指挥完毕。创造新纪录了！
Control out. New record!

392
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,300
人工驾驶的潜艇，
首次在南极洲下潜至1000米！
First manned sub dive
to 1,000 metres in Antarctica!

393
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,259
在海床上，这个世界的尽头，
At the bottom of the ocean, at the
end of the world,

394
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,220
所发现的物种数量，令人目瞪口呆。
the amount of life they find is
astonishing.

395
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,939
同样令人目瞪口呆的是，
But they are equally astonished
to find that,

396
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,339
海平面下的三分之二英里处，
two thirds of a mile from the
surface,

397
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,260
冰山依旧危机四伏。
icebergs are still a danger.

398
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,139
冰山融化过程中，可能有石块坠落，
Rocks can drop from them
as they melt,

399
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,140
这一块，正好坠于潜艇前方。
and one lands
right in front of the sub.

400
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,939
大部分开着潜艇的人，都不曾想到，
I don't think many people who are
diving subs

401
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,380
还会有被大块落石坠击这等怪事。
ever consider big lumps of rock
landing on them.

402
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,819
这，这是非一般的风险。
It's, it's not your normal risk.

403
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,299
如果石块击中船身，
If it had hit the sphere,

404
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,299
很有可能产生划痕。
there's a good chance it would have
put a nice scratch down it.

405
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,659
如果被10，15甚或20吨的重物击中的话，
If something of ten, 15, 20 tonnes
had hit the sub,

406
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,300
潜艇就成为废铁了。
it would completely destroy it.

407
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,659
但其后的数次下潜，
But over the following dives

408
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,699
令队员们意识到，
正是这些坠落的石块，
the team learns it's these
very drop stones

409
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,500
使南极洲深海变得富饶，
that enrich the Antarctic
deep sea bed,

410
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,220
因为它们为生命的欣欣繁衍，
提供安居之所。
creating firm anchor points
for life to thrive.

411
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,579
看来，要想对深海生物的
复杂性和多样性心领神会，
Proof that the only way to fully
appreciate the complexity and

412
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,900
唯一办法，就是亲自下来走一趟。
abundance of life in the deep
is to go there ourselves.

413
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,980
下一集，我们将进入繁华的珊瑚礁。
Next time, we travel to bustling
coral reefs.

414
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,739
这里，动物们必须使出浑身解数，
Here, animals must go to
extraordinary lengths

415
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,500
以求在拥挤城市那成存败亡的
竞择游戏中，占得先机……
to get ahead of the competition in
these crowded cities.
